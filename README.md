The repository in question represents the starting point of a student project aimed at replicating the functionality of the Airbnb website. In this initial stage, the focus is on creating a backend interface, often referred to as a console. This console is designed to handle program data and offers commands that enable users to perform actions like creating, updating, and deleting objects, in addition to managing file storage.

A crucial aspect of this project is the use of JSON serialization and deserialization, which ensures that the data remains persistent even when the program is closed and reopened. This means that the information is saved in a structured format, making it available for future use and maintaining consistency between different sessions of the program.
